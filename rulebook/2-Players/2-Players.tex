\section{Player Creation and Transactions}

\subsection{Roster information}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item Rosters must have a minimum of 9 players including 1 pitcher.
	A team may not field a roster of over 20 players.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item A pinch-hitting GM (see \hyperref[sec:GMs as Players]{GMs as Players})
		does not occupy a roster slot.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Player creation}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item Player names submitted by a player cannot be changed
	without approval from the commissioner’s office.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Names may not match or strongly resemble those of active MLB players.
		\item Names may not bully or demean other players or members of the community.
		\item No alternate accounts may be used.
		Players and GMs are limited to using one account in the game,
		and discovery of the use of an alternate account
		will result in an immediate and permanent ban of both accounts.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item Reporter accounts are the only exception (see \hyperref[sec:reporters]{reporter rules})
		\end{deepEnumerate}
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Players are required to have a Reddit account in good standing to sign up.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Reddit accounts under 6 months of age and with minimal karma
		may be rejected as part of our policy on alternate accounts.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item Accounts not meeting these requirements may be vouched for
			by existing members of the community in good standing.
		\end{deepEnumerate}
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Position players have the opportunity to choose their primary and secondary positions.
	Available secondary positions for each primary position are listed below.
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
			\hline
			Primary position & Available secondary positions         \\
			\hline
			Catcher          & First base, third base                \\
			\hline
			First base       & Third base, left field                \\
			\hline
			Second base      & Shortstop, first base, right field    \\

			\hline
			Left field       & Right field, first base               \\
			\hline
			Center field     & Left field, right field               \\
			\hline
			Right field      & Center field, first base              \\
			\hline 
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Lineup creation}
\label{sec:lineups}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item Starting lineups mut be valid when submitted.
	Invalid starting lineups must be fixed as soon as possible,
	or risk being overridden by a default lineup
	or one set by the commissioner’s office (see \nameref{sec:game rules}). 
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item A valid lineup consists of 9 (or 10 when using a DH) players,
		in positions they are each eligible for, with all positions represented.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item Players are eligible to play either their primary or secondary position.
			\item Players playing out of position may be allowed 
			on a case-by-case basis with valid reason,
			and must be approved by the commissioner’s office.
		\end{deepEnumerate}
		\item Pitchers may only play as pitchers.
		They may not play a defensive position other than pitcher.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item Pitchers may pinch hit or play a position in case of emergency.
		\end{deepEnumerate}
		\item Any player is eligible to slot in as DH.
		\item Since catcher is not an available secondary position,
		a backup "emergency" catcher may be designated prior to each game.
		\item Position player pitching
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item Position players may come in to pitch in a game
			when both of the following are true:
			\begin{deepEnumerate}
				\item All pitchers on the team's roster are unavailable.
				\item The umpire believes the substitution 
				of a position player to pitch is necessary or justified.
			\end{deepEnumerate}
			\item Position players that pitch will never get a hand bonus
			and have a special pitching range (see \nameref{sec:ranges index}).
		\end{deepEnumerate}
		\item GMs as players
		\label{sec:GMs as Players}
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item GMs have two options if they would like to play in a game.
			\begin{deepEnumerate}
				\item Full time player-GM
				\begin{deepEnumerate}
					\item Full time player-GMs occupy a roster spot on their team
					and are eligible to start in a game for their team.
					\item They also choose a primary and secondary position, type and hand.
					These are not able to be changed until the offseason.
				\end{deepEnumerate}
				\item Pinch hitter GM
				\begin{deepEnumerate}
					\item Pinch hitter GMs do not occupy a roster slot on their team
					and are not eligible to start in a game for their team.
					\item They also choose a type and hand,
					which are not able to be changed until the offseason.
					\item Pinch hitter GMs may pinch hit for any player at any point in the game.
					They assume the position of the player they are replacing,
					but cannot be moved to other positions once in the game.
				\end{deepEnumerate}
			\end{deepEnumerate}
		\end{deepEnumerate}
	\end{deepEnumerate}
\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Signing free agents}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item After signing up, players will be posted to the GM channel and the free agent list.
	Once posted, they enter a 12-hour no-signing period.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Free agents cannot officially accept a contract until the 12-hour window has passed.
		This time should be used to consider offers from every team who extends one.
		\item The time and date of the no-sign period will be included on the free agent listing.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Free agents signed while a team's game is ongoing are not eligible to play in such game.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Gifted free agents by the commissioner’s office are an exception to this rule.
		\item Newly signed players are eligible to play in MiLR.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item To sign a free agent to a team, a GM must post a confirmation from the player
	(date included) to the GM channel in the Discord.
	\item The commissioner’s office reserves the right to deny free agent signings
	if they do not follow procedure or in the case of conflict,
	such as multiple teams' claims on a free agent.
	\item Players that are not listed on the free agent list may not be signed prior to their posting.
	This includes free agents who have been wiped from the list
	(they will need to sign up and be posted again).
	\item A free agent may inform the commissioner’s office of retiring,
	in which case they will be removed from the list.
\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Releasing players}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item A player's tenure on a team is considered at-will, 
	and players may be released for any reason.
	\item Players will be placed on three-day waivers when released.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Waiver claim order is defined as the reverse order 
		of the most recent semi-official power rankings 
		published by the Major League Redditball Awards Association (MLRAA).
		That is, the lowest ranked team has the highest waiver priority.
		\item If the player clears waivers, 
		they revert to free agent status and may be signed by any team.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Placing players on hiatus}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item If a player knows they will unavailable for a time,
	their GM may place them on the hiatus list.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Valid hiatus reasons include, but are not limited to,
		parental responsibilities, vacations, mental health, school reasons, etc.
		\item The commissioner’s office must approve all hiatus list additions,
		and GMs must provide proof of a player's situation to corroborate the request.
		\item Teams must be able to field a valid lineup (see \nameref{sec:lineups})
		without the player being moved to hiatus.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Players on the hiatus list do not occupy a roster slot
	and may not play in any game,
	but remain under team control.
\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Player suspensions}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item Players may be suspended by their team or by the commissioner’s office.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Suspended players may not play in any game, but do occupy a roster slot.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Players suspended by the commissioner’s office may appeal the decision within 24 hours.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item The appeals committee shall consist of 
		one GM, one player committee member, and one member of the commissioner’s office.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item Each of these groups may select their appeals committee member,
			but chosen appeals committee members may fill any holes by themselves
			if any members are not chosen within 12 hours.
			\item Anyone directly involved in the matter at hand,
			or affiliated with the suspended player's team,
			may not be involved with the appeal committee.
		\end{deepEnumerate}
		\item The commitee shall hear from both the suspended player
		and the league official who handed down the suspension.
		\item When the committee is ready, they may privately deliberate.
		\item The committee shall then vote on how to handle the suspension.
		The three possible outcomes are:
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item Overturning the suspension
			\begin{deepEnumerate}
				\item This requires a unanimous vote of the appeals committee.
			\end{deepEnumerate}
			\item Reducing the duration of the suspension
			\begin{deepEnumerate}
				\item This requires a $\frac{2}{3}$ vote of the appeals committee.
				\item The reduction is determined by the appeals committee.
			\end{deepEnumerate}
			\item Upholding the suspension
			\begin{deepEnumerate}
				\item This is the default outcome.
			\end{deepEnumerate}
		\end{deepEnumerate}
		\item The committee has 72 hours to make a final ruling.
		If they fail to do so,
		a new committee is formed under the same procedures and the process begins anew.
		\item While a suspension is being appealed,
		the player's suspension is delayed until resolved,
		and they may play normally.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Suspensions must be handed down either:
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Between sessions, or
		\item When the player is not currently playing in a game.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Replacement of general managers}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item In the event of an unplanned departure of a GM,
	the team's primary captain becomes acting GM.
	Their status as a player is unaffected.
	The OOTC can choose the acting GM at their sole discretion
	if the primary team captain is not suitable for any reason.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Departure here is defined as no longer fulfilling standard GM duties
		such as setting lineups.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item Discord presence is strongly recommended but not explicitly required.
			In the case of a Discord absence a player must be appointed
			to represent the team in the GM channel.
			They will be deemed an Interim GM.
		\end{deepEnumerate}
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item The team may collectively put forth a teammate for consideration for the GM position.
	\item In the event no teammate is chosen 
	or in cases of their being denied by the commissioner’s office,
	the commissioner’s office will submit 3 candidates to the team.
	One of these candidates must be chosen by the team to become the new GM.
	\item The Mutiny Clause: Additional conditions for GM removal
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item 3 missed lineup submissions
		\item 80\% or 10 players vote of no confidence from team
		\item 2 games lost to Auto-K/BB forfeit or 10 Auto-K/BBs per 4 game session.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Team captains}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item GMs may designate a primary team captain and up to two secondary team captains.
	These players must be disclosed to the OOTC and they can be added or removed at any time.
	\item Team captains can make emergency substitutions and set emergency lineups
	in the case of an unavailable GM
	(see \hyperref[sec:substitutions]{Substitutions} and \hyperref[sec:captain lineups]{Captain Lineups}).
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Umps should not initiate contact with team captains
		except in extreme cases or otherwise stated in the rulebook.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
\end{deepEnumerate}
