		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item Players are eligible to play their primary, secondary, or third positions.
			\item Players playing out of position may be allowed on a case-by-case basis with valid reason,	and must be approved by the League Operation Managers.

		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item Pitchers may pinch hit or play a position in case of emergency.
		\end{deepEnumerate}

				\end{deepEnumerate}
			\end{deepEnumerate}
		\end{deepEnumerate}
	\end{deepEnumerate}
\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Signing free agents}
\begin{deepEnumerate}

	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Free agents cannot officially accept a contract until the 12-hour window has passed.
		This time should be used to consider offers from every team who extends one.
		\item The time and date of the no-sign period will be included on the free agent listing.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Free agents signed are not eligible to play for their MLR team during the current MLR session.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Free agents gifted by the Commissioner's Office are exempt from this rule.
		\item Newly signed players are eligible to play in MiLR during the session they are signed.
	\end{deepEnumerate}

	\item The League Operation Managers reserve the right to deny free agent signings if they do not follow procedure or in the case of conflict,
	such as multiple teams claiming a free agent.
	\item Players that are not listed on the free agent list may not be signed prior to their posting.
	This includes free agents who have been wiped from the list	(they will need to sign up and be posted again).

\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Releasing players/Waivers}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item A player may be released at any time for any reason.
	\item Players will be placed on three-day waivers when released.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item For the first three sessions of the season, Waiver Claim order is the same as the draft order in the most recent draft.
		\item After Session 3 ends, the Waiver Claim order for each player will be determined by applying the \hyperref[sec:Draft order]{Draft order}
		to the league standings	as of the last session in which all games have been completed.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item If a session has been completed but games are continuing past the end of the session, 
			that session will be used and the records of those teams once those games have been completed will be used.
		\end{deepEnumerate}
		\item If the player clears waivers, they revert to free agent status and may be signed by any team.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Placing players on hiatus}

		\item The commissioner's office must approve all hiatus list additions,	and GMs must provide proof of a player's situation to corroborate the request.
		\item Teams must be able to field a valid lineup (see \nameref{sec:lineups}) without the player being moved to hiatus.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Players on the hiatus list do not occupy a roster slot and may not play in any game, but remain under team control.
\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Retired Players}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item A player may retire any time.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Retirement immediately removes the player from the team’s active roster.
		\item The retired player must be substituted out of any game they are currently playing.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item If the player returns in the same season in which they retired, the player will be returned to the team they left upon retirement.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item GMs may return the player to the active roster, release the player, or trade the player. This must be done prior to the start of the
		following session. Failure to take action on a returning player will result in releasing the player.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item GMs will have at least 48 hours to take action. If the player returns with fewer than 48 hours remaining in the current session,
			the decision will be due by the end of the following session.

\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Player suspensions}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item Players may be suspended by their team or by the commissioner's office.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Suspended players may not play in any game but still occupy a roster slot.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Players suspended by the commissioner's office may appeal the decision within 24 hours.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item The appeals committee shall consist of 
		one GM, one player committee member, and one member of the commissioner's office.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item Each of these groups may select their appeals committee member, but chosen appeals committee members may fill any holes by themselves
			if any members are not chosen within 12 hours.
			\item Anyone directly involved in the matter at hand or affiliated with the suspended player's team	cannot be on the appeals committee.
		\end{deepEnumerate}
		\item The appeals commitee shall hear from both the suspended player and the league official who issued the suspension.
		\item When the committee is ready, they may privately deliberate.
		\item The committee shall then vote on how to handle the suspension. The three possible outcomes are:
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item Overturning the suspension
			\begin{deepEnumerate}
				\item This requires a unanimous vote of the appeals committee.
			\end{deepEnumerate}
			\item Reducing the duration of the suspension
			\begin{deepEnumerate}
				\item This requires a 2/3 vote of the appeals committee.
				\item The reduction is determined by the appeals committee.
			\end{deepEnumerate}
			\item Upholding the suspension
			\begin{deepEnumerate}
				\item This is the default outcome.
			\end{deepEnumerate}
		\end{deepEnumerate}
		\item The committee has 72 hours to make a final ruling. If they fail to do so, a new committee is formed under the same procedures and the process begins anew.
		\item While a suspension is being appealed,	the player's suspension is delayed until resolved and they may play normally.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Suspensions must be handed down either:
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Between sessions, or
		\item When the player is not currently playing in a game.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Trading}

		\item The players involved in a trade are moved to their new teams after the current session, prior to the start of the next session.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Good Faith Trading
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item All GMs must participate in trade discussions in good faith.
			\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item Good Faith is here defined as not grossly misrepresenting the activity of a player either in their level of discord activity or the last time they were active.
			\end{deepEnumerate}
		\item If any GM is found to have misrepresented the conditions of the trade, that trade is void unless renegotiated
		\item Any trade that is found to grossly benefit one team may be overturned at the discretion of the OOTC 
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Trade Deadline
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item The trade deadline is set at 12pm ET on the first day of session 13.

\subsection{Replacement of general managers}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item In the event of an unplanned departure of a GM, the team's primary captain becomes acting GM.	Their status as a player is unaffected.
	The League Operation Managers or Commissioners can choose the acting GM at their sole discretion if the primary team captain is not suitable for any reason.

		\item Departure here is defined as the GM leaving the GM position for any reason, including but not limited to stepping down, retiring, or being removed via mutiny.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item Discord presence is strongly recommended but not explicitly required.	In the case of a Discord absence a player must be appointed

		\end{deepEnumerate}
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item The team may collectively put forth a teammate for consideration for the GM position.
	\item In the event no teammate is chosen or in cases of their being denied by the League Operation Managers or Commissioners,

	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item 3 missed lineup submissions
		\item 80\% or 10 players vote of no confidence from team

\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Offseason Player Movement}
\label{sec:OPM}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item At the end of each season, players may opt to depart from the Club to which they are currently signed.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Players who signed with their club prior to the Trading Deadline, or who have appeared in at least 6 regular season MLR or MiLR games, shall be eligible

		\item All players opting to depart from their club who do not opt into the free-agent pool shall be part of the draft pool.
		\item Players changing position under the \hyperref[sec:OPC]{Offseason Positional Changes rules} remain subject to those rules.

	\item Number of rounds
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item The Starting number of rounds will be 6

	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Number of picks
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Teams may draft up to their roster cap (currently 20 players). Teams may pass at any round.
		If a team passes, they are passing on all remaining rounds. There is no minimum number of players a team must draft.
		\item Teams may trade picks. A team will be able to claim their own or acquired (via trade) picks in that round if their player roster is below the current roster limit.
		A team that has traded their pick for that round must also have a player roster below the current roster limit.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item  If a team can not provide the promised pick, the standard procedure will be that
			the team given a faulty pick shall select a player from the guilty team's roster. The GM of the guilty
			team's roster may protect a number of players equal to the draft round in question. For example, if
 			team A promised a 3rd round pick and cannot provide it, Team B may select any player from Team A's
 			roster except 3 protected players decided by Team A's GM.
		\end{deepEnumerate}
	\end{deepEnumerate}

			\end{deepEnumerate}
			\item MLR Runner-Up
			\item Paper Cup Champion
		\end{deepEnumerate}
		\item For any ties within any category, the tie shall be broken by strength of schedule, with the lowest percentage getting the highest pick.
		\item For any ties remaining after the strength of schedule tiebreaker, apply all of the following:
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item Determine the lowest seeded team among teams in the same division using the \hyperref[sec:Division tiebreakers]{Division tiebreakers}
			\item Determine the lowest seeded team among remaining teams in the same league using the \hyperref[sec:Wildcard tiebreakers]{Wildcard tiebreakers}
			\item Determine the lowest seeded team among remaining interleague teams using the following:

		\item If expansion teams are added, they will receive 2 picks at the start of each round in a random, snaking order.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Any free agent may re-sign with their team up until the draft. Any player who is a Free Agent during the draft may
	 not re-sign with their old team until the end of session 1. If a team did not benefit during the draft from said player being
	 off their roster then that player may re-sign with their old team under normal free agency rules. 
\end{deepEnumerate}
