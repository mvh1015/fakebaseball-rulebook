		\item The other election will appoint 2 members to start Session 13 of each season.
		\item All players and GMs of the community will be eligible to vote.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item In the event that a Commissioner resigns, is removed, or is otherwise no longer capable of fulfilling the role, the following procedure shall take place 
	if there is reasonable time (at least 3 sessions) before the next regular election:
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item An emergency election will be held, taking no longer than one session.
		\item The elected Commissioner will hold the position for the remainder of the term of the departing Commissioner.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item In order to be eligible to become a Commissioner, a person must meet the following requirements:
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Must have been an active (non-retired) member of the community for 6 months prior to the election before being elected.

		\item Must not have been removed from a Commissioner role by the committee.	
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item At any point, the committee is capable of impeaching a Commissioner, forcing an immediate replacement process. This will require a two thirds vote to pass.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Impeachment and removal proceedings will follow this procedure:
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item To impeach a commissioner, 5 committee members must all co-sponsor a Motion of Impeachment which details the reasons for impeachment.

			A discussion period of no less than 36 hours will be started as with any other proposal.
			\item At the close of the discussion period, a vote on removal will be held for a period not less than 36 hours. 
			There will be at least 2 pings for the vote, 1 at the beginning of the vote and one 24 hours later.
			\item At the close of voting, if 2/3rds of votes are cast in favor of removal, the Commissioner will be removed for their position. 
			A quorum of 60\% of voters is required for a removal vote to be final and valid.
		\end{deepEnumerate}
		\item Once a Motion of Impeachment has been brought against a Commissioner, that Commissioner will be suspended from all powers and duties of their office 
		until such time as impeachment proceedings have concluded.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Rule interpretation/implementation}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item The MLR Committee is responsible for introducing new rules and procedures to the league, and operates continuously within its own framework.
	Its constitution can be found \hyperref[sec:Committee Constitution]{here}.
	\item For any situation or circumstance in which there is not a rule, the Commissioner's Office may create whatever rules are necessary
	for the function of the league.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item These rules are not codfied in the rulebook until presented to and approved by the Committee.
		Rejection by the Committee does not override the rule. Only passing a new rule can override a Commissioner's Office rule.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Rule interpretation may vary between officials. In the event of any rule dispute, the Commissionerâ€™s Office has final say in the interpretation of the rule.
\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Player Conduct}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item Players must report to any team they are signed, drafted, or traded to, regardless of their real-world allegiances or opinions of a team's real-world analog.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Quitting or otherwise becoming inactive chiefly due to these feelings	may be met with a ban from the league.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Reporter figures and accounts are actively encouraged,
	\label{sec:reporters}
	but if operated by an active player or GM, their identity must be divulged to the commissioner's office	to avoid any concerns of using alternate accounts.
	\item All community members must treat all other league members with respect, regardless of their position in the league.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
