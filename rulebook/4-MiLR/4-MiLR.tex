\section{Minor League Redditball (MiLR)}

\subsection{Structure}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item Minor League Redditball (MiLR) is the official minor league affiliate of MLR.
	\item MiLR consists of a single league of 16 teams, 
	with 15 MiLR team being affiliated with 2 MLR teams and the last being a team consisting of GMs and free agents. 
	These team pairings are determined randomly prior to each MLR season.
	\item MiLR games follow the same schedule as MLR games, 
	the only exception being that sessions begin and end one day later than MLR sessions.
	\item The MiLR regular season consists of 14 sessions. 
	The league will be split into two groups of 8 with games played in a double round robin format.
	\item After the 14 game regular season, the top four MiLR teams by record per group will advance to the MiLR playoffs, 
	which consist of a semifinal and final game to be played parallel to sessions 15 and 16 of the MLR regular season.
	\item The MLR teams affiliated with the MiLR champion team each earn a first round protected draft pick in the next MLR Draft 
	unless the GM/Free agent team wins, in which case no picks will be awarded.
\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Team structure}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item Every MLR team must send 5 people to their MiLR team every session.
    \item Players playing in a MiLR game may also play in their team’s MLR game, 
    but they do not receive the MiLR benefits (see: third position rules).
    \item It is recommended, but not required, for a team to have a single person designated as their MiLR GM, 
    who will be responsible for creating lineups and acting as the point of contact for umpires and MLR GMs.
    \item Unlike MLR, MiLR teams may not have a default lineup due to the constant turnover of players.
    \begin{deepEnumerate}
        \item If an MLR GM has not submitted a list of at least 5 players to play in MiLR by the start of a MiLR session, 
        the MiLR GM may ping that MLR team in their MiLR team channel asking for volunteers. 
        \item If no MiLR lineup is submitted within the first 3 hours of the start of a MiLR session, 
        the commissioner’s office reserves the right to create a lineup in its place. 
        If MLR GMs have submitted players in the MiLR Discord channel, those players will be used in this lineup. 
        If a team has not submitted any players, 
        the commissioner’s office reserves the right to choose which of that team’s players will play in MiLR.
        \begin{deepEnumerate}
            \item As always, these automatic reps can be subbed out if desired by the MiLR GM.
        \end{deepEnumerate}
    \end{deepEnumerate}
\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Third position}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
    \item Players participating in MiLR may begin earning a third position of eligibility for MLR. 
    This third position does not have the same restrictions as normal secondary positions - 
    that is, any position player may choose any position to add as their third position 
    (pitchers are ineligible for this benefit).
    \item Players must accrue 9 plate appearances in MiLR at their desired third position to acquire it.    
    \begin{deepEnumerate}
        \item Plate appearances that result in an auto K or take place during a session in which they also play in MLR do not count towards this total.
        \item Players that bat in the DH or P positions may apply their plate appearances to the position of their choice, 
        provided they have previously earned at least one plate appearance in that position.
        \begin{deepEnumerate}
            \item Pitchers that do not bat are not eligible for this benefit.
            \item Players must confirm with the MiLR League Manager which position they want to apply these plate appearances to, 
            and must do so prior to the beginning of the next session. 
            DH and P plate appearances are lost if they are not assigned prior to the beginning of the next session.
            \begin{deepEnumerate}
                \item It is the player’s responsibility to confirm, not the MiLR League Manager's.
            \end{deepEnumerate}
        \end{deepEnumerate}
        \item Upon reaching the requisite 9 plate appearances, players will be asked to confirm their third position. 
        Upon doing so, they become eligible to play that position in MLR.
    \end{deepEnumerate}
    \item Third positions may only be changed in the offseason, 
    and players must still meet the 9 plate appearance requirement for the position they desire to change it to.
    \item Players may decide to replace their primary or secondary position instead of using those at bats for a third position. 
    This would require 9 plate appearances exactly like gaining a third position. 
    This is not restricted by traditional primary/secondary position pairings, 
    for example, you could take catcher as a secondary position. 
    This may only be done during the offseason. 
    Doing this will reset all progress towards new positions.
\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Free agents}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
    \item Free agents may play in MiLR games by declaring their intention to do so 
    to the MiLR League Manager or in the free agent market Discord channel. 
    Depending on volume, free agents will either be assigned (high volume) 
    or can be picked up by teams for individual games (low volume).
    \item If a free agent plays in 2 MiLR games without recording an Auto K, 
    they will be eligible to change their primary/secondary positions in the middle of the season. 
    If the free agent was on an MLR team prior to this position change, 
    they are not allowed to re-sign with that team until the end of the season.
    \begin{deepEnumerate}
        \item This benefit may only be used once per season.
        \item Players who change position in this fashion will be reposted as if they were a new player, 
        and will be subject to the normal 12 hour waiting period.        
    \end{deepEnumerate}
