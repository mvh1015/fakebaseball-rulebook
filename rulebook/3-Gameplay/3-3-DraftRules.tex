\subsection{Draft Rules}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item Number of rounds
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item The Starting number of rounds will be 6
		\item The number of rounds may be changed depending on the amount of sign-ups
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Number of picks
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item All teams will be guaranteed a minimum of a first and second round pick if
		 enough players are available. 
		\item Starting in the 3rd round, a team will be able to claim their own or acquired
		 (via trade) picks in that round if their player roster is 6 or more players below the
		 current roster limit. A team that has traded their pick for that round must also have
		 a player roster at 6 or more players below the current roster limit
		\item  If a team can not provide the promised pick, the standard procedure will be that
		 the team given a faulty pick shall select a player from the guilty team’s roster. The GM of the guilty
 		team’s roster may “protect” a number of players equal to the draft round in question. For example if
 		team A promised a 3rd round pick and cannot provide it, Team B may select any player from Team A’s
 		roster except 3 protected players decided by Team A’s GM.
	\end{deepEnumerate}

		 the group participates in and shall be in the reverse order for every other occurrence (snaked).
		\item If expansion teams are added, they will receive 2 picks at the start of each round in a random, snaking order.
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Any free agent may re-sign with their team up until the draft. Any player who is a Free Agent during the draft may
	 not re-sign with their old team until the end of session 1. If a team did not benefit during the draft from said player being
	 off their roster then that player may re-sign with their old team under normal free agency rules.
