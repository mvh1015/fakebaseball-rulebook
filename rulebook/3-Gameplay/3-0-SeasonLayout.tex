\subsection{Season Layout}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item Seasons consist of a schedule of 16 games followed by playoffs.
	\item Games are played one at a time, in periods of time called "sessions".
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Sessions are 10 days long.
		\item Sessions begin two days after the previous session ends.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item Exceptions to this may occur due to holidays or shortage of league officials.
		\end{deepEnumerate}
		\item Games begin on the first day of the session, generally at 12pm ET.
		\item Games that are not completed by 12pm ET on the final day of the session,
		(that is, 240 hours after the start of the session)
		are designated as shortened games.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item If the home team is winning 
			and the game is in the bottom of the inning
			when the session concludes,
			the game will automatically end with the home team declared the winner.
			\item Otherwise, games will end at the end of the current inning.
			If the game is tied, the inning is treated as the 6th inning,
			and any further innings will be played under extra inning baserunner rules
			(see \hyperref[sec:extra innings]{Extra innings}).
			\item All games that run over the end of the session 
			are subject to shortened extra-inning auto timers
			(see \hyperref[sec:extra innings]{Extra innings}) 
			effective immediately upon session end.
		\end{deepEnumerate}
		\item The trade deadline is set at 12pm ET on the first day of session 13.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item PTBNL or Future Considerations can not be settled by moving players after the trade deadline.
			 They must either be settled before the deadline or during the offseason.
		\end{deepEnumerate}
		\item Playoff format
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item From each league, three division chapions and three wild card teams will advance to the playoffs.
			\item The playoffs consist of four rounds:
			the Wild Card round, the Divisional Games, the League Championship Games, and the Paper Cup.
			Teams will be seeded first by division winners followed by the wild card teams.
			\begin{deepEnumerate}
				\item The Wild Card round is the first round of the playoffs. 
				In each league the wild card teams and the lowest seeded division winner will face off. 
				The division winner will host the lowest seeded wild card team 
				and the highest seeded wild card team will host the middle seeded wild card team.
				\item The Divisional Games is the league semifinal round. 
				In each league, the top seeded team hosts the lower ranked winning team from the Wild Card round, 
				and the second seeded team hosts the higher seeded winning team from the Wild Card round.
				\item The League Championship Game is the game to decide the American League and National League champions. 
				The higher of the two remaining seeds hosts the lower seed.
				\item The Paper Cup is the game that decides the champion of the Major League Redditball season. 
				Home field advantage is determined by regular season record, 
				with the wild card tiebreakers applied as necessary.
			\end{deepEnumerate}
			\item Tiebreakers
			\begin{deepEnumerate}
				\item Ties between two teams are applied in the following order:
				\begin{deepEnumerate}
					\item Division tiebreakers: 
					1) Head-To-Head Record $\rightarrow$  
					2) Record vs Division $\rightarrow$ 
					3) Strength of Victory $\rightarrow$ 
					4) Strength of Schedule $\rightarrow$ 
					5) Run Differential $\rightarrow$  
					6) Number of Autos $\rightarrow$ 
					7) Home Run Derby (10 outs)
					\item Wildcard tiebreakers: 
					1) Head-To-Head Record $\rightarrow$  
					2) Record vs Common Opponents $\rightarrow$ 
					3) Strength of Victory $\rightarrow$ 
					4) Strength of Schedule $\rightarrow$ 
					5) Run Differential $\rightarrow$  
					6) Number of Autos $\rightarrow$  
					7) Home Run Derby (10 outs)
				\end{deepEnumerate}
				\item Ties between 3 or more teams are applied in the following order
				\begin{deepEnumerate}
					\item 1) Head-To-Head Record $\rightarrow$  
					2) Record vs Common Opponents/Division $\rightarrow$ 
					3) Strength of Victory $\rightarrow$ 
					4) Strength of Schedule $\rightarrow$ 
					5) Run Differential $\rightarrow$  
					6) Number of Autos $\rightarrow$  
					7) Home Run Derby (10 outs)
					\item If a team is eliminated from a tiebreaker while two or more teams remain, 
					the tiebreaker process will be started over with the remaining teams, starting from Point 1.  The only exception to this is if a tie breaker is encountered in the order where one team beats all other teams in the same tiebreak, in which case, they will be awarded the playoff spot.
				\end{deepEnumerate}
				\item In the event of multiple teams being tied for both a division and a wildcard spot, 
				the division tiebreaker will be run first, 
				and once a qualifier has been pulled from there, 
				the wildcard tiebreaker will then be ran, 
				with the division winning team not counting 
				for the purposes of the “Combined Record vs Tied Opponents” tiebreaker.
				\item If two teams are tied for multiple wildcard spots, 
				we will run a tiebreaker once to get the first team, 
				and then start a fresh second tiebreaker, 
				not including the first playoff qualifier.
