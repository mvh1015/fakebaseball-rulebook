\subsection{Game rules}
\label{sec:game rules}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item This game being modeled after real baseball, 
	any situation or definition not covered under the rules in this section 
	will default to MLB rules and procedures.
	\item Game procedure
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Umpires are designated by the Ump Warden, 
		or the commissioner’s office in case the Ump Warden is unavailable.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item Umpires are responsible for setting up the game thread 
			and pinging pitchers and batters for numbers, 
			as well as keeping track of game state.
			\item When assigned, umpires are listed on the schedule tab of the rosters sheet. 
			GMs are required to send in their lineups on time.
			\begin{deepEnumerate}
				\item Lineups may be sent to the Ump Warden at any time. 
				They will be directed to the appropriate ump by the Ump Warden.
				\item GMs may designate a “default lineup” for umps to use 
				if a lineup is not submitted within the first 3 hours of the beginning of a session.
				\begin{deepEnumerate}
					\item If a player on a team’s default lineup is traded or released, 
					the default lineup must be adjusted before the release or trade is approved.
					\item If a team has not set a default lineup, 
					and that team has not submitted a lineup within the first 3 hours of the beginning of a session, 
					the commissioner’s office reserves the right to create a lineup in their place.
					\item If a GM has not set a lineup for a session and the session has begun, 
					\label{sec:captain lineups}
					team captains can submit an emergency lineup within the first 3 hours of the beginning of a session 
					to be used in place of the default lineup.
					\begin{deepEnumerate}
						\item An ump may ask a team captain for an emergency lineup during this window.
					\end{deepEnumerate}
				\end{deepEnumerate}
			\end{deepEnumerate}
		\end{deepEnumerate}
		\item Games last 6 innings in regulation time. 
		If the game is tied after six innings, extra innings will be played to determine the winner. 
		See \hyperref[sec:extra innings]{Extra innings}.
		\item As soon as a pitch is needed, the umpire shall notify the pitcher either via Discord or Reddit message.
		\item When a pitch number is acquired, 
		the umpire shall post a top-level comment on the game thread signaling the batter’s plate appearance. 
		This must include the player’s username as a mention so they get a notification. 
		The umpire is also recommended to mention the player in the Discord if applicable, 
		but this should be seen as a courtesy and is not required.
		\item The player then replies to the top-level comment with their swing. 
		There must be a clear number to be used as the swing, but may optionally include roleplay or other commentary.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item If multiple numbers are included in the writeup, the batter must make clear which one is the swing. 
			If there is no clear swing, the umpire will use the last number in the swing comment. 
			To ensure the correct swing is used, batters should include it at the very end of the comment, 
			e.g. “Swing: 123”.
		\end{deepEnumerate}
		\item The umpire shall post the result of the plate appearance as a reply to the player’s swing.
		\item Instances of communicating pitch or swing numbers, real or fake, 
		between the current pitcher and batter constitutes unsportsmanlike conduct and will be met with a suspension.
		\item Umpire mistakes
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item In any case of an umpire misapplying rules, general procedure shall be:
			\begin{deepEnumerate}
				\item Reversal of the play if another batter has not completed a plate appearance since the error.
				\item Continuation of play if another batter has completed a plate appearance since the error.
				\item This procedure applies generally to every situation. 
				In some cases, the commissioner’s office may make a different determination of how play shall proceed.
			\end{deepEnumerate}
		\end{deepEnumerate}
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Auto timers
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Both pitchers and batters are subject to an auto timer from the time they are pinged to the time they submit a number.
		\item The auto timer consists of a hard limit of 12 hours.
		\item Players have until the auto timer expires to submit a number and fulfill their obligation.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item For example, a batter that is summoned for a plate appearance at 9am has until 9pm to submit a number.
		\end{deepEnumerate}
		\item If a player fails to fulfill their obligation, an auto is issued.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item For batters who fail to provide a number, they are issued an automatic strikeout. 
			This strikeout is credited to the batter and pitcher but officially counts as an automatic strikeout.
			\item For pitchers who fail to provide a number, the batter they are set to face is issued an automatic walk. 
			This walk is credited to the batter and pitcher but officially counts as an automatic walk.
			\item Any numbers submitted after the hard cap has passed are invalid and will be ignored.
		\end{deepEnumerate}
		\item Pitchers who are issued two consecutive automatic walks must be automatically subbed out.
		\item Delays of game
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item A team that is caught purposely delaying a game will forfeit the game. 
			Teams caught purposefully delaying a game are given a 9-hour auto timer for the game following the forfeiture.
			\item Warnings for delay of game shall be issued to a team after 3 total auto walks or strikeouts by that team.
			\item 5 total auto walks or strikeouts by a team in a game shall result in automatic forfeiture of the game by that team.
		\end{deepEnumerate}
		\item The auto timer may be paused for certain situations.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item Pinch hitters and pitcher substitutions automatically pause the timer (see \hyperref[sec:substitutions]{Substitutions}).
			\item The commissioner’s office may also pause auto timers leaguewide for special events such as holidays. 
			Players and GMs should keep an eye on Discord announcements for these cases.
		\end{deepEnumerate}
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Extra innings
	\label{sec:extra innings}
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item Games may enter extra innings if the score after 6 innings is tied. 
		The following additional rules apply to games in innings 7 and later:
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item Teams begin each extra inning with baserunners according to the following table.
			\begin{center}										                
				\begin{longtable}{|p{3cm}|p{8cm}|}
					\hline
					\textbf{Inning} & \textbf{Beginning situation}                                          \\
					\hline
					7th             & The player who batted last in the 6th inning is placed on second.     \\
					\hline
					8th             & The player who batted last in the 7th inning is placed on second.     
					The player who batted second-to-last in the 7th inning is placed on third. \\
					\hline
					9th or later    & The player who batted last in the previous inning is placed on first. 
					The player who batted second-to-last is placed on second.
					The player who batted third-to-last is placed on third. \\
					\hline
				\end{longtable}
			\end{center}
			\item All runners who begin an inning on base shall be counted as unearned to the pitcher. 
			The runner is also not credited with a run if they score.
			\item In extra innings, the auto timers are shortened to a soft 6, hard 12 hour cap.
		\end{deepEnumerate}
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Substitutions
	\label{sec:substitutions}
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item GMs and team captains are responsible for making substitutions during the course of the game.
		All substitutions default to MLB rules for lineup rules, including the DH rule (see valid lineup rules).
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item For those unfamiliar with the MLB rules, listed below are the most common and important rules.
			\begin{deepEnumerate}
				\item Players who exit the game may not be substituted back into the game in any capacity.
				\item Players may not move between slots in the batting order.
				\item Quick overview of the DH rule
				\begin{deepEnumerate}
					\item If the DH takes up another defensive position, the team forfeits the use of the DH for the rest of the game. 
					The pitcher bats in the slot of the player who is replaced in the field by the DH.
					\item Only players who are not already in the game may sub in at DH.
				\end{deepEnumerate}
			\end{deepEnumerate}
		\end{deepEnumerate}
		\item Pitching changes must be announced in the game thread as a top-level comment separate from or immediately preceding a plate appearance.
		\item Pinch hitters must be presented to the pitcher prior to a plate appearance. 
		The pitcher shall be given a reasonable opportunity to change their pitch in the event of a pinch hitter.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item This need not apply in the case of a list pitcher. 
			Instead it’s highly recommended to ask a list pitcher how they want pinch hitters handled before they begin pitching.
			\item The auto timer for the plate appearance will pause when the substitution is made by the GM/Captain, 
			regardless of when the umpire responds to it, 
			and will resume at the time the new pitch is confirmed. 
			As a courtesy to avoid confusion, 
			umpires should post in the new plate appearance how much time is remaining before an auto.
		\end{deepEnumerate}
		\item Substitutions are official and final immediately upon being sent to the umpire by the GM or acting GM.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item Substitutions involving one or more conditions shall be considered official and final immediately upon all their conditions being met. These types of subs may be cancelled by the GM before the conditions are met, and GMs must do so explicitly.
			\item Substitutions are to be made by either: 1) sending a message to all of the involved umps or 2) posting a top-level comment in the game thread. If neither of these two are met, the substitution will not be official.
			\item If an umpire presents a pinch hitter to the current pitcher, 
			any further changes regarding that pinch hitter prior to the announcement 
			(e.g. changing which player will pinch hit) 
			must also be presented to the current pitcher.
		\end{deepEnumerate}
	\end{deepEnumerate}
	\item Ejections
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
		\item GMs or players may be ejected from the game by an umpire.
		\begin{deepEnumerate}
			\item Ejected GMs must choose a player to take their place. If no choice is made, this will be your primary team captain.
			\item Ejected players must be replaced with a valid substitution (see valid lineup rules).
			\item Ejected persons should refrain from commenting in the game thread.
		\end{deepEnumerate}
	\end{deepEnumerate}
\end{deepEnumerate}
