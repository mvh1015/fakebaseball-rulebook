\subsection{Rule interpretation/implementation}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
    \item Rules are always malleable by the commissioner's office.
          Suggestions may be made for consideration by the commissioner's office.
          All rules are ineffective until explicitly approved by the commissioner's office.
    \item The commissioner’s office may not post a rule officially 
          until it has been at the very least presented to the committee room 
          prior to implementation (see Committee). % TODO LINK
    \item Rule interpretation may vary between officials.
          Concerns with the rules interpretation shall be directed to the commissioner’s office.
\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Committee}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
    \item The MLR Committee is responsible for introducing new rules and procedures to the league,
          and operates continuously within its own framework.
          Its constitution can be found here. % TODO LINK
\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Player Conduct}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
    \item Players must report to any team they are signed, drafted, or traded to,
          regardless of their real-world allegiances or opinions of a team's real-world analog.
          \begin{deepEnumerate}
              \item Quitting or otherwise becoming inactive 
                    chiefly due to these feelings
                    may be met with a ban from the league.
          \end{deepEnumerate}
    \item Reporter figures and accounts are activley encouraged,
          but if operated by an active player or GM,
          their identity must be divulged to the commissioner’s office
          to avoid any concerns of using alternate accounts.
    \item All community members must treat their peers with respect,
          be it their GM, teammates, or other teams.
          \begin{deepEnumerate}
              \item Trash talk is normal an encouraged
                    (on Discord and in trash talk and game threads),
                    but the commissioner’s office reserves the right to moderate conversations.
                    Don't make things personal.
              \item Players and GMs who feel disrespected by someone on their team or in the league 
                    may file a grievance with the commissioner’s office.
                    Possible action can include a ban from the league and free agent compensation.
